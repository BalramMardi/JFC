The steel giant, known for its pioneering role in the\r\n            development of sports in India, secured Jamshedpur as the host city\r\n            and participated in the ISL under the name Jamshedpur Football Club.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p className=\"text-gray-700\">\r\n            The club plays its home matches at the iconic JRD Tata Sports\r\n            Complex, fondly known as ‘The Furnace,’ which boasts the highest\r\n            average attendance for ISL matches since the club's formation, with\r\n            over 20,000 fans per game.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n        <section className=\"mb-8\">\r\n          <h2 className=\"text-2xl font-semibold mb-4\">\r\n            Performance and Growth\r\n          </h2>\r\n          <p className=\"text-gray-700\">\r\n            In its first two seasons, Jamshedpur FC finished 5th on the Hero ISL\r\n            table, narrowly missing out on the semi-finals.
